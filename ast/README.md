## Statements and Expression 

 - Expression
   - An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a single value.
   - It can be as simple as a literal value or as complex as a combination of multiple operations.
   - Expressions can be used in various context, such as assigning values to variables, passing arguments to functions, or as a part of control flow structures.

 - Statement
    - A statement is a standalone unit of execution that performs some action.
    - Unlike expressions, statements do not necessarily produce a value. They may include declarations, assignments, loops, conditionals, and function calls.
    - Statements are typically used to control the flow of a program or to perform specific actions.
