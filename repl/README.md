### Read-Eval-Print-Loop

A Read-Eval-Print Loop, or REPL, is a computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user. REPLs provide an interactive environment to explore tools available in specific environments or programming languages.

In other words, the REPL makes your runtime more tangible and allows you to test hypotheses about it. The REPL reads input, sends it to the interpreter for evaluation, prints the result/output of the interpreter and starts again. Read, Eval, Print, Loop.

The REPL doesn't need to compile or deploy your code. This leads to a very short response time (<100ms). Thus, you are able to test your hypotheses without losing the flow.
